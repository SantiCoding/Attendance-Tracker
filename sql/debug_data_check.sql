-- DEBUG DATA CHECK: See what's in the database and how it's linked
-- This will help us understand why data disappears on reload

-- Step 1: Check if user_id columns exist

-- Step 6: Check for orphaned data (data without user_id)
SELECT 'Orphaned data (without user_id):' as info;

  COUNT(*) as orphaned_count
FROM coach_profiles
